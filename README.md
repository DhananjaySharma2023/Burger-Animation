# 🍔 Animated Burger Button

I created this fun animated burger button because I was craving a burger once and thought, "Why not make a virtual one?" Now I can enjoy a virtual burger without getting hungry! 😋

## 💻 Tech Stack

- `HTML`
- `CSS`

## 💡 How It Works

When you hover your mouse over the burger icon or click on it, the burger's parts, like the bun, lettuce, and tomato, get separated and move around.

## The Power of CSS

This project proves that CSS is more powerful than we might think. It's not just for styling web pages. It can bring interactivity and life to our designs. So, never underestimate the magic of CSS. ✨
